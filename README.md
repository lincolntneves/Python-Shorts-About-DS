# Shorts About Python
Here I keep some Python notebooks with the mostly use codes on my daily as a Data Scientist.



#### [01. Working with pandas.merge() to join two dataframes](https://bit.ly/3Qf6SaZ)<br>
This notebook adresses the use about join dataframes with pandas. Go here.


#### [02. Concating two or more dataframes using concat() and append()](https://bit.ly/3zwHkAu)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use concat() and append() to union two or more dataframes.


#### [03. Count distinct values from a dataframe's column with nunique()](https://bit.ly/3MGXiej)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use nunique() to count distinct values.


#### [04. Create new dataframe column with apply and lambda function](https://bit.ly/3NNXbPu)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use lambda function to build columns flags


#### [05. Drop duplicates rows with drop_duplicates()](https://bit.ly/3mDogJa)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use drop_duplicates() to remove rows on a dataframe through some columns or rows with the same values on each column.


#### [06. Use groupby() and agg() functions on Pandas to summarize data](https://bit.ly/3xkN2Tg)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use groupby() and agg() together.


#### [07. Create new dataframe column with apply and def and condicional function](https://bit.ly/3ttT2rE)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use apply() with def + if condicional to build a flag column on dataframe.
